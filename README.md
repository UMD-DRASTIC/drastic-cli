# Overview

Drastic is a data management solution written in Python that allows users to upload, describe, and archive data resources.  Data is managed in a distributed Cassandra database. All changes to data in the repository are followed by a message that describes the change. By responding to messages, the usual repository functions may be extended to include arbitrary workflow. For more information, please see the [project website](https://umd-drastic.github.io/).

# drastic-cli

This is source code for the DRAS-TIC command-line interface (CLI), which is client software for interacting with a DRAS-TIC repository from the local command-line or terminal. Please see the [installation and usage document](https://github.com/drastic-deploy/tree/master/docs/CLI.md) for detailed instructions.
